### What is Machine Learning?
>"What we lack in knowledge, we make up for in data" ~ Unkown

Machine learning is inferring knowledge from data.
- Learning - optimizing a performance criterion.
- Programing machines (computers) to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience.

Types of Machine Learning Models:
- Predictive:
    - Make predictions on the future based on data already known.

- Descriptive:
    - Gain knowledge from data we are given.

Types of learning:
- Predictive:
    - Supervised Learning:
        - When we have examples of input and output data.

- Descriptive:
    - Unsupervised Learning:
        - We only have the input data and do not know what the out should be.

- Reinforcement Learning:
    - Semi-Supervised Learning:
        - We do not have output data, but we teach it in much the same way as a predictive algorithm.

Machine Learning is Statistical Learning:
- Machine learning uses the theory of statistics in building mathematical models, because the core task is making an inference from a sample.
